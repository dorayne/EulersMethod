# EulersMethod

This is something I wrote quickly to use Euler's Method for calculating differential equations.

The differential equation, initial values, horizontal step, and goal x-value are all hard coded.

### To-Do:

- Accept user input for:
	- Initial x- and y- values
	- Horizontal step
	- Goal x-value
- More complicated equations
- Be able to accept keyboard math notation as user input for an equation
- Make the output more clear or easier to read
